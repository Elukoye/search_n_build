# Project: Search_and_Build rails API

## Live version of project : [Search_and_Build rails API](https://fast-falls-25301.herokuapp.com/)

## Link to API Documentation: [Search_and_Build rails API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11639084/T17Dg8ox)


## Description
This Ruby on Rails capstone is based on creating API's for selecting tutorials, viewing their details and setting a date on when to build the project.Inspiration for this project was derived from the original capstone project as below: 
**Final Capstone Project [backend-only variant]** is based on an app to book an appointment to try a motorcycle. You will be building an API for this app. You should familiarize yourself with the given design of the website as it is going to be your API client.

## Special rules
Technical mandatory requirements of the project:

- [ ] The database should have at least 2 tables ‚Äî in this example, motorcycle models and appointments, i.e., the appointments can be accessed by all users unless you implement a proper user authentication (more on this later)
- [ ] Create a user table in your database, so that a given user could only access the objects they created
- [ ] Create endpoints for admin actions: create / update / delete objects (not protected by under "admin" namespace)
- [ ] For the back-end you will use Ruby on Rails
    - [ ] You will create a REST API to manage database resources, in this case, measurements (things to measure could be added manually to the database or from an admin panel)
- [ ] Your API should have a public documentation page similar to this one
   
## Technologies
- [ ] Ruby on Rails
- [ ] Postman
- [ ] RSpec
- [ ] JWT gem

##  API Features
- [ ] The APIs can Create  a user account by typing the username and password
- [ ] Client can use the APIs to create a session to login an existing user
- [ ] The APIs restrict endpoints accessibility for projects and appointments unless the use has been authenticated and has an existing account.
- [ ] The APIs can be used to fetch data for projects and appointments created by a user.

## Added Feature
- [ ] Implemented JWT token authentication for admin action endpoints
